# Results for Project 3 by Ellen Avrumova #

# Merge Sort #
This sorting method was faster than quick sort 1 but slower than quick sort 2.
Size 10000 & max elem size 100: 110 ms.
Size 100000 & max elem size 100: 743 ms.
Size 1000000 & max elem size 100: 8291 ms.

This size lagged so I won't continue to a bigger size.

# Quick Sort 1 #
This sorting method was slower than merge sort regardless of the pivot.

Size 10000 & max elem size 100 & good pivot: 120 ms.
Size 10000 & max elem size 100 & bad pivot: 145 ms.
Size 100000 & max elem size 100 & good pivot: 4845 ms.
Size 100000 & max elem size 100 & bad pivot: 5900 ms.

This size lagged so I won't continue to a bigger size.

# Quick Sort 2 #
This is the quickest sorting method by far.
Size 10000 & max elem size 100 & good pivot: 2 ms.
Size 10000 & max elem size 100 & bad pivot: 3 ms.
Size 100000 & max elem size 100 & good pivot: 26 ms.
Size 100000 & max elem size 100 & bad pivot: 27 ms.
Size 1000000 & max elem size 100 & good pivot: 261 ms.
Size 1000000 & max elem size 100 & bad pivot: 283 ms.

At this size there is barely a lag which shows how fast it sorts the data set.
